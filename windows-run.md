# Running the app for Windows.

Probably you'll have issues running the app using Windows. As a workaround you could run it using WSL:

1. Install OS (Ubuntu, for instance) to WSL:

```bash
$ wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```
3. Open WSL terminal.
2. Install node: https://docs.microsoft.com/pl-pl/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl
3. Install bazel http://bazel.build (for Ubuntu https://bazel.build/install/ubuntu)
4. Install ibazel https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-watcher#installation
5. Clone the repository.
6. Run the app
```bash
```
